## Installations and Dependencies 

1. Express - to run the server through node.js
2. Express Handlebars - the view of the page is built through handlebars
3. mySQL - allows use of local SQL database
4. dotenv - for storage of SQL password

## Usage 

> IMPORTANT: Please ensure that all node modules have been installed in the local directory, and that the SQL database has been created on your local machine, before beginning.

After proper installations and setup, begin the server through node.js (">node server.js") and navigate to the server where listed in the CLI. You may then interact with the program. The app is very simple - through the "Uneaten Burger List" on the left side, you may click the "devour" button to permanently relocate the burger name to the "devoured" category on the right. In addition, using the form at the bottom of the page will allow uses to submit new burgers for the "Uneaten" list to be later, of course, devoured.
